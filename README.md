# Sketchboost
Sketchboost is a new original assistant site for artists based on artificial intelligence and machine learning.
# Site Features 
1. The site provides an accessible artistic base.
2. The site has its own library of art references, as well as a library of palettes.
3. The site allows authorized users to upload their palettes and references for machine learning and to replenish the library.
4. The site is a fast, convenient and accessible assistant at any time, supporting the art industry and its development.
5. The site gives recommendations for your work/drawing specified by the user.
# Working method
The site has a chat field with AI, as well as an image upload location An authorized user has the opportunity to upload his own image and assign an existing command to the bot. The bot performs an image analysis, on top of which the changes will be superimposed as a new layers. the chat has the functions of checking artistic perspective, composition, selecting a palette based on the clientâ€™s request, and has the functions of making the correct flat/volumetric lighting. The chat also provides written recommendations and links to video tutorials for relevant requests. 
# Benefits of the project 
In addition to being an accessible assistant, the site can also help the art industry as a whole. Currently, the art industry is generally opposed to the use of AI for artistic purposes, as it could put them out of work. this site, which runs on AI, serves as an assistant to artists rather than taking away their work. on the contrary, it can help develop the art industry, make the work of artists easier and develop AI itself.
